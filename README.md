# WIP: Ethico

### How to currently run this

There are two seperate branches in this repo, "main" contains the front end, "backend" the backend server that does the handeling of the OpenAI api calls as well as some calculations.

You need both to run the programm. 

backend is designed to run on port 3001.
the backend needs a .env file containing a openai api key:
`OPENAI_API_KEY=YOUR_APIKEY`

Download the full repo, set one terminal on main branch and run `npm start`

In a second terminal set it to run on backend branch and again, run `npm start`

Alternatively, both branches can be downloaded to seperate folders.

### This is still very much work in progess.
